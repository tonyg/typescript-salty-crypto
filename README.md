# salty-crypto

A TypeScript implementation of the [Noise Protocol Framework](https://noiseprotocol.org/),
intended to be runnable both in the browser and server-side. Also includes just enough minimal
crypto code (partly from [tweetnacl.js](https://github.com/dchest/tweetnacl-js), partly code I
wrote [myself](https://leastfixedpoint.com/) from the RFCs) to get
`Noise_*_25519_ChaChaPoly_BLAKE2s` working.

## Example

The noise protocol needs some way to transport encrypted packets back and forth. This could be
a TCP/IP socket, a WebSocket, or something similar. Let's represent this transport as a pair of
functions:

```typescript
async function writePacket(packet: Uint8Array): Promise<void>;
async function readPacket(): Promise<Uint8Array>;
```

Then, on the initiating ("connecting") side,

```typescript
import { Handshake, Noise_25519_ChaChaPoly_BLAKE2s } from 'salty-crypto';
const I = new Handshake(Noise_25519_ChaChaPoly_BLAKE2s, 'NX', 'initiator');
const { send, recv } = await I.completeHandshake(writePacket, readPacket);
...
await writePacket(send.encrypt(message));
...
const message = rect.decrypt(await readPacket());
...
```

On the responding ("listening") side, the code is exactly the same, except with `'responder'`
instead of `'initiator'`.

If you want to check the peer's static (~identity) key, access the `remoteStaticPublicKey`
field of the `Handshake` object. To supply a long-lived identity keypair when handshaking, pass
in a `HandshakeOptions` structure with a `staticKeypair` member to the `Handshake` constructor.

## Status

Includes (and passes) test vectors from [noise-c](https://github.com/rweather/noise-c/) and
[snow](https://github.com/mcginty/snow/).

## Potential next steps

 - support AESGCM, SHA256, SHA512, perhaps via `Crypto.subtle`?
 - support BLAKE2b, by implementing from the RFC just like BLAKE2s
 - `fallback` pattern modifier
