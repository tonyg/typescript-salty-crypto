# salty-crypto

A TypeScript implementation of the [Noise Protocol Framework](https://noiseprotocol.org/),
intended to be runnable both in the browser and server-side. Also includes just enough minimal
crypto code (partly from [tweetnacl.js](https://github.com/dchest/tweetnacl-js), partly code I
wrote [myself](https://leastfixedpoint.com/) from the RFCs) to get
`Noise_*_25519_ChaChaPoly_BLAKE2s` working.

## Status

Includes (and passes) test vectors from [noise-c](https://github.com/rweather/noise-c/) and
[snow](https://github.com/mcginty/snow/).

## Potential next steps

 - support AESGCM, SHA256, SHA512, perhaps via `Crypto.subtle`?
 - support BLAKE2b, by implementing from the RFC just like BLAKE2s
 - `fallback` pattern modifier

## Code overview

 - `src` directory:
    - [`aead.ts`](src/aead.ts): RFC-8439 ("IETF") ChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD construction
    - [`blake2.ts`](src/blake2.ts): RFC-7693 BLAKE2s hash function
    - [`chacha20.ts`](src/chacha20.ts): RFC-8439 ("IETF") ChaCha20 cipher
    - [`noise.ts`](src/noise.ts): Core Noise Protocol Framework handshake and CipherState
      implementation
    - [`patterns.ts`](src/patterns.ts): Library of Noise handshake patterns
    - [`poly1305.ts`](src/poly1305.ts): Port of [the Poly1305 MAC implementation from
      tweetnacl.js](https://github.com/dchest/tweetnacl-js/blob/6a9594a35a27f9c723c5f1c107e376d1c65c23b3/nacl-fast.js#L462-L817),
      which in turn ported [Andrew Moon's Poly1305-donna-16
      code](https://github.com/floodyberry/poly1305-donna/blob/e6ad6e091d30d7f4ec2d4f978be1fcfcbce72781/poly1305-donna-16.h).
    - [`profiles.ts`](src/profiles.ts): Profiles of the Noise Protocol Framework. Currently
      just `Noise_25519_ChaChaPoly_BLAKE2s`.
    - [`random.ts`](src/random.ts): Port of [the randomness-generation code from
      tweetnacl.js](https://github.com/dchest/tweetnacl-js/blob/6a9594a35a27f9c723c5f1c107e376d1c65c23b3/nacl-fast.js#L2363-L2389).
    - [`x25519.ts`](src/x25519.ts): Port of [the X25519 key agreement implementation from
      tweetnacl.js](https://github.com/dchest/tweetnacl-js/blob/6a9594a35a27f9c723c5f1c107e376d1c65c23b3/nacl-fast.js#L852-L1379).
 - `test-vectors` directory: Contains Noise test vectors (more-or-less in the [standard JSON
   format](https://github.com/noiseprotocol/noise_wiki/wiki/Test-vectors)) copied from other
   projects.
 - `test` directory: Contains a test driver and test code.
